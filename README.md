# CVApplication


My first react application (a CV creator) built with React for the <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application'>Odin Project Curriculum</a>.

You can add your personal information, educational experience, and job experience and have it formatted into a neat CV. You can switch in and out of edit mode to change the values you've provided.
